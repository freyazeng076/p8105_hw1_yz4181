# Question 1 

### Create a dataframe

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

df = tibble(
  samp = rnorm(10),
  samp_logical = samp > 0,
  samp_character = nchar(samp),
  samp_levels = as.numeric(as.factor(samp_character))
)
```

### Calculate the mean of each variable in dataframe
```{r}
#calculate the mean of random size of 10
x = pull(df, var = 1)
mean(x)

#calculate the mean of logical vector
logical_vector = pull(df, var = 2)
mean(logical_vector)

#calculate the mean of character vector
character_vector = pull(df, var = 3)
mean(character_vector)

#calculate the mean of factor vector
factor_vector = pull(df, var = -1)
mean(factor_vector)
```
